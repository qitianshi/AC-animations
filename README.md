# Phasor animations
Short animations demonstrating phasors and phasor properties.

## Start here
If you just want to use my finished videos, links will be added here
soon. First, make sure you take a look at the [licensing requirements
for videos](#license).

You can also clone this repo if you want to edit my code (you'll need
Python 3.10 and matplotlib):

```
git clone https://github.com/qitianshi/phasor-animations.git
```

## Status
I'm working on it. 😵‍💫
