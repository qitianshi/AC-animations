# Phasor animations
Short animations demonstrating phasors and phasor properties.

## Start here
If you just want to use my finished videos, [see the 'gif'
folder](https://github.com/qitianshi/phasor-animations/tree/main/gif).
*More will be added soon.* First, make sure you take a look at the
[licensing requirements for videos](#license).

You can also clone this repo if you want to make your own custom
animations using my code (please credit me, Qi Tianshi). You'll need
Python 3.10 and matplotlib.

```
git clone https://github.com/qitianshi/phasor-animations.git
```

## Status
A few videos are currently up. As for the rest... I'm working on it. 😵‍💫
