# AC animations
Short animations demonstrating the physics of alternating current, including
phasors, signals, & RLC.

* [Animated sinusoidal AC](https://github.com/qitianshi/AC-animations/tree/main/videos/ac_voltage).
* [Animated electric signals](https://github.com/qitianshi/AC-animations/tree/main/videos/signals_galvanometer)
  (including sinusoid, sawtooth, square, rectified) with an animated
  galvanometer.
* [Animated phasors](https://github.com/qitianshi/AC-animations/tree/main/videos/simple_phasors)
  demonstrating phasor resolution, phase difference, frequency, etc, with
  corresponding animated sinusoids.
* [Animated advanced phasor properties](https://github.com/qitianshi/AC-animations/tree/main/videos/phasor_addition),
  including vector addition and manipulation, with corresponding animated
  sinusoids.
* [Animated RLC](https://github.com/qitianshi/AC-animations/tree/main/videos/rlc)
  VI graphs demonstrating leading and lagging.

## Start here
If you just want to use my finished videos, [check out the 'videos'
folder](https://github.com/qitianshi/phasor-animations/tree/main/videos/). But
first, make sure you follow the
[licensing requirements for videos](#license).

You can also clone this repo if you want to make your own custom
animations using my code (please credit me, Qi Tianshi). You'll need
Python 3.10 and matplotlib.

```
git clone https://github.com/qitianshi/AC-animations.git
```

## Status & Contributing
Most of what I've planned is already up. I might add more in the future. In the
meantime, you're more than welcome to submit pull requests to add new stuff (be
warned: the code is a *mess*; it was a quick bodge job), or request stuff on
the [Issues](https://github.com/qitianshi/AC-animations/issues) tab.
